# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A beginner Python terminal game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 10.

## 🧠 How it Works
- The computer randomly picks a number from 1 to 10.
- You start with a score of 10.
- Each wrong guess reduces your score by 1.
- The game ends when you guess correctly.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Using `random` module
- Loops, conditionals
- Input handling and validation
